let str = 'shubham';

console.log(str.includes(part));
// the above statement tells us weather the string includes a certain part or not...it will return boolean according to it...
console.log(str.startsWith('s'));
// as the name of the function suggests that it check weather a string startsWith the supplied argument or not in this case our string 'shubham' starts with 's' so it is true
console.log(str.endsWith('am'));
//same thing as startsWith when it is done in the ending of the string we will make good use of endsWith function and as our string 'shubham' ends with 'am' the condition is evaluated as true...
