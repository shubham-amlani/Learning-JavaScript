// console.log is used to pring anything in javascript
// a variable can be made in JS using var, let and const
// var is deprecated and should not be used in fresh codes due to some limitations
// let can be used to make variables whose datatypes can be changed in runtime, and const is like static and it's type cannot change in runtime.
//While making practical programs we will use const more likely and sometimes we will use let also as per conditions.
