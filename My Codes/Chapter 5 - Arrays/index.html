//This is a simple way to make an array in JavaScript.
//Array is a container which is used to store multiple elements in a program, these elements can be of same data-type or of different ones, any primitive or non-primitive data-type can be stored in an array
let marks = [100, 99, 94, 83, 74, 36, "string", false, null];
//We can access elements of an array like this.
console.log(marks);
console.log(marks[0]);
console.log(marks[1]);
console.log(marks[2]);
console.log(marks[3]);
console.log(marks[4]);
console.log(marks[5]);
console.log(marks[6]);
console.log(marks[7]);
console.log(marks[8]);
//If we try to access element which is not present in an array it will return undefined, any primitive or non-primitive data-type can be stored in arrays.
//But note that any undefined value can be later changed and that will change the element of the array For Eg: 
marks[9]='shubham'
console.log(marks[9]);
//This will now no more print undefined as value is assigned to it, again it can be of any valid data-type of JS.
//We make good use of .length property to know the length of an array.
console.log("The length of array marks is "+ marks.length);
//We can also change the values in an array, so, arrays are mutable and they can be changed
marks[0]=99;
console.log(marks[0]);
