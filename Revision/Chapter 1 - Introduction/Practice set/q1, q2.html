    let str1 = 'Shubham ';
    let str2 = 'Amlani'
    let num = 34;
    console.log(str1+num);
    //here it does not produce error, it instead concatenates them.
    console.log(typeof (str1+num))
    //as it concatenates, it converts the number into a string and together they become a string so its type is also identifies as a string.
