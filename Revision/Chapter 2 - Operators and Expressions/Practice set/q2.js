//In expression there can be any valid arithematic expression and based on that expression any case is selected and case need not to be started from one and need not to be in an order we can just write random numbers but they should be a valid number.

//There is need for break statement in every case or else every case after the matched case is run.
//No need to use break keyword in default as there is no case after it so only defalut will be executed.
